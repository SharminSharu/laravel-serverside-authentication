# Laravel Server Side DataTables And Custom Authentication
This ultimately works using DataTables in Laravel 10 file (server-datatable.zip). And develop a custom authentication system in Laravel file (auth-laravel.zip).

## Deployment
I have implemented a server-side DataTable in Laravel, which is encapsulated in the file named server-datatable.zip. To set up this project, you will find two Laravel zip files within the repository. These files should be placed in the htdocs\nagadhat-laravel directory. Afterward, extract the contents from the zip files, and the project will be ready for deployment. I have developed a custom authentication system within Laravel, and the relevant files can be found in the auth-laravel.zip archive To run the project, execute the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```
you may import the SQL file provided in the repository from the database folder into your localhost/phpMyAdmin. This will establish the necessary database structure for the Laravel Authentication system contained in the auth-laravel.zip file.

To access the system, please use the following credentials:

```bash
Username:sharmin@gmail.com
password:12345
```
