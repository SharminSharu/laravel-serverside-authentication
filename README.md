# Laravel Server Side DataTables And Custom Authentication
This ultimately works using Yajra DataTables in Laravel 10 file (server-datatable.zip). And also develop a custom authentication system in Laravel file (auth-laravel.zip).

## Deployment
There are two Laravel zip files. These two files are added to htdocs\nagadhat-laravel. Then compress from the zip files Then it works.
To deploy this project run
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Sql file (server-side.sql) is added from the database folder in localhost/phpmyadmin then this Website runs with the databases for Laravel Authentication (auth-laravel.zip) file.

```bash
Username:sharmin@gmail.com
password:12345
